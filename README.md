# Developer Portfolio

A portfolio to showcase the skills I have taught myself as an aspiring Developer.

Built with Gatsby to serve a super fast static site, all the data is held locally for now but with future plans to fetch project data from a headless CMS such as Contentful so I can add blog functionality. The animation libraries used are locomotive-scroll and framer-motion.

#### Technologies

- Gatsby 3.0
- SASS
- locomotive-scroll
- framer-motion

## Status

Complete. With future plans to improve data storage utilising graphql and Contentful. I also want to add blog functionality but I’m hesitant to break away from the simplicity of a single page site.

## Reflection

As a site intended to sell myself to potential employers / clients I wanted it simply to be visually appealing and quickly state my skill level and interests.

The greatest challenge was the design. Teaching myself to code, I inevitably focussed mainly on the technical side of frontend development, and tutorials don’t put much emphasis on visual appeal above functionality. Drawing heavily on showcase site like Awwwards and One Page Love really helped me discover current trends and produce the clean, modern design that I wanted to use to display my projects.
